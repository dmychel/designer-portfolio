          My professional life has certainly bounced around. However there is a
          common theme amongst the jobs that have left an impact on me, and that
          theme is creation. Whether it be technically driven or art driven I
          have a passion for creating. I was born and raised in the low-income
          parts of Boston Massachusetts. Being in this environment forced me to
          grow up fast, but also gave me the opportunity to become involved in a
          lot of communities that would shape who I am today. Outside of work I
          try to maintain as many hobbies as possible. Iâ€™ve been dancing since I
          was a kid and still do today. I enjoy photography, rock climbing,
          tricking (acrobatic discipline), and a bit of no Gi Jiu-Jitsu.
